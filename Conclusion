To summarize, the structure of a snowflake is mainly determined by the temperature and moisture 
levels in its environment. The geometry of snowflakes is based on a hexagonal system.
Although no two snowflakes are exactly identical, there are general categories of snowflake geometries,
including fernlike, dendritic, plate, and stellar. The study of how snowflakes form gives insight 
into the process of crystal formation.
